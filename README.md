# Welcome to My Linear Regression Learning Path

Welcome to any and all observers! In this repository you will find a sort of... finalization of my ML learning path for linear regression. Here I cover some slightly more advanced topics than the ones found in the first ML linear regression repository. Upon completion, this new knowledge will be used for some beginner-friendly data in the next repository.

Here's to learning fun stuff ðŸ¥‚.

(An update from future me: I had more topics to cover than I thought.)
